Download and install mongoDB

Open command prompt:
c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin
>mkdir \data\db    (Make a directory for db- this is the default location)
>mongod            (Setup mongoDB onto our system)

Setup PATH in environment variable so that we can directly run all mongoDB commands 
from cmd(any location) without going to the bin directory.
MyComputer > Properties > Environment Variable > PATH > Add the mongoDB bin location.

Now to run mongoDB commands,
>mongo
start writing the mongo commands.
