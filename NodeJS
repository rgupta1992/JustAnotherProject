Node JS:
-------

Helps to create server side applications.
It is good for real time applications(like chat apps)

After installations :
type >node  in cmd ,
now we can write javascript code in command prompt

Webstorm > new File > app.js   : Node JS first runs this file(its like the main file)

run the app by typing > node app    in cmd
