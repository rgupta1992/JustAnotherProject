Programming:
JavaScript Object:

var person = { 'name':'Rahul', 'age':23}
function:
----------
>function without return statement, returns undefined when called.
>We can intialize a variable with anynomous function.

var hello = function(){
                       console.log("Hello");
                       };
hello();                // prints Hello
We can pass this fuction to other functions using the variable.
Eg:   setTimeout(hello, 5000);                  //print hello after 5 seconds.

Handling Multiple Request:
---------------------------

Users   --  Server  --  DB
>Server takes some time to get data from DB.
>If there are large number of users and server needs process each request one by one , it takes a lot of time.
>So instead of waiting for a request to complete before getting another request, the server can take request from
 other users and start processing those parallely.
>Once the request are process the server provides the response.This way the server does not need to stay idle until a request is 
  processed.
